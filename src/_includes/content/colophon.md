This is my personal website, for your enjoyment. It's also for just tinkering, experimenting, and having fun. Let's be honest, it's mostly for _my_ enjoyment.

It's made out of HTML and CSS, with a sprinkling of JavaScript, and the help of [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). Hosting is provided by [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

The typeface is [Mona Sans](https://github.com/mona-sans). Icons are from [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/).

Beer recipes and batches are designed and tracked using [Brewfather](https://brewfather.app/), and syndicated here via their API.
