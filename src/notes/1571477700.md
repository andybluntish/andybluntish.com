The cleaner came into the bathroom at the airport while I was using it and started mopping. Pretty normal. Then some other guy comes in and starts taking photos of the dude mopping. Less normal. The photographer was standing directly behind me as I was still using the urinal. Very much definitely not normal.

At this point I'm only 85% sure the camera was pointing at the cleaner... 😳
