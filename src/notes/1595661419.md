I recently drew up a home-made game of "pin the tail on the donkey" for my kid's birthday party. 

After the first try, the donkey had a butt that looked _disturbingly_ human and _upsettingly_ sensuous. We ended up going with my second attempt—which was much more donkey–like—but that first one haunts me still.
