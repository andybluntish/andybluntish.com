<div>
Gâ€™day, my name is [Andy](/) <span role="img" aria-label="waving hand">ðŸ‘‹</span>

Iâ€™m a software engineer from Australia. I love using the web to build things that make peopleâ€™s lives easier. I enjoy pragmatic, user-friendly design, and believe in a responsibly delivered, accessible experience for everyone.

I also like _fun_ things, such as riding my bike, brewing my own [beer](/beer/brew-log/), and beating my kids at video gamesâ€”while I still can. I spend my days building tools that help people receive the care they need, and _I love it_.
