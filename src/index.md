G’day, my name is [Andy]({{ site.url }}/) 👋

I’m a software engineer from Australia. I love using the web to build things that make people’s lives easier. I enjoy pragmatic, user-friendly design, and believe in a responsibly delivered, accessible experience for everyone.

I also like _fun_ things, such as riding my bike, brewing my own [beer](/beer/), and beating my kids at video games—while I still can. I spend my days building tools that help people receive the care they need, and _I love it_.
