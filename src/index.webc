<div>
  <p>Gâ€™day, my name is <a href="/">Andy</a> <span role="img" aria-label="waving hand">ðŸ‘‹</span></p>
  <p>Iâ€™m a software engineer from Australia. I love using the web to build things that make peopleâ€™s lives easier. I
    enjoy pragmatic, user-friendly design, and believe in a responsibly delivered, accessible experience for everyone.
  </p>
  <p>I also like <em>fun</em> things, such as riding my bike, brewing my own <a href="/beer/brew-log/">beer</a>, and
    beating my kids at video gamesâ€”while I still can. I spend my days building tools that help people receive the care
    they need, and <em>I love it</em>.</p>
