  <p>G’day, my name is <a href="https://andybluntish.com/" rel="me" class="u-url p-name"><span class="p-given-name">Andy</span></a> 👋</p>
  <p>I’m a <span class="p-role">software engineer</span> based in <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Adelaide+SA+Australia" class="p-adr h-adr"><span class="p-locality">Adelaide</span>, <span class="p-country-name">Australia</span></a>. I’m a huge fan of the web, and love using technology to help solve problems.</p>
  <p>As a <em>developer</em>, I love writing code that makes people’s lives easier. I’m excited about pushing the web forward, and the possibilities offered by the latest tools and technology. As a <em>designer</em>, my focus is on producing simple, intuitive products that allow people to get work done. I love building pragmatic, accessible interfaces that are attractive and easy to use.</p>
  <p>I want the web to work. I’m a strong proponent of a <a href="http://futurefriendlyweb.com/">future friendly</a>, <a href="https://www.webstandards.org/">standards compliant</a> web, and believe in a responsibly delivered, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">accessible</a> experience for everyone.</p>
  <p>I also like <em>fun</em> things, such as riding my bike, and brewing my own beer. I spend my days building tools that help make the web faster, and <em>I love it</em>.</p>
