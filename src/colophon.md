This is my personal website, for your enjoyment. It’s also for tinkering, experimenting, and having fun. Let’s be honest—it’s mostly for _my_ enjoyment.

The site is made out of plain ol' HTML and CSS, with a sprinkling of JavaScript _(but only when strictly necessary)_. Pages are built with the help of [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [WebC](https://github.com/11ty/webc), and hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

The recipes and batches in the [Brew Log](/beer/brew-log/) are designed and tracked using [Brewfather](https://brewfather.app/), and syndicated here via their API.

The tippity-taps happen inside [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) and [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/). If you care, my [dotfiles](https://github.com/andybluntish/dotfiles) are on GitHub—but do note this is _not_ an endorsement of their use, by anyone.

The purdy pictures are made purely for my own amusement with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and the [Affinity suite](https://affinity.serif.com/). You'll likely never see them. The jangly sounds are made with my Telecaster and Eastman T386. You'll likely never hear them.

Made with <span role="img" aria-label="orange heart">🧡</span> in the land down under.
