# {{title}}

This is my personal website, for your enjoyment. It’s also for tinkering, experimenting, and having fun. Let’s be honest, it’s mostly for _my_ enjoyment.

The site is made out of good old-fashioned HTML and CSS, with a sprinkling of JavaScript. Pages are built with the help of [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [WebC](https://github.com/11ty/webc), and hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

Beer recipes and batches are designed and tracked using [Brewfather](https://brewfather.app/), and syndicated here via their API.
